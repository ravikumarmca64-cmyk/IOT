ENVIRONMENT QUALITY MONITORING SYSTEM 

In industrial environments, maintaining air quality, temperature, and noise levels within safe limits is essential for worker health and operational efficiency. This project focuses on developing an IoT-based Industry Environment Quality Monitoring System using the ESP32 microcontroller. The system is designed to continuously monitor environmental parameters such as temperature, humidity, gas concentration, and sound levels, providing real-time data visualization on the ThingSpeak web portal. By leveraging IoT technology, this system enables remote monitoring and automated alerts to ensure a safe working environment.  

The system incorporates various sensors, including the DHT11 for measuring temperature and humidity, the MQ135 for detecting harmful gases, and the MAX9814 for monitoring sound levels. The ESP32 microcontroller collects data from these sensors and transmits it wirelessly to the cloud for real-time analysis. The ThingSpeak platform is used to display the collected data in a graphical format, allowing users to monitor trends and take necessary actions when required. Additionally, an alert mechanism is implemented to notify users when sensor readings exceed predefined safety thresholds, ensuring timely intervention to prevent hazardous conditions.  

The implementation of this system is beneficial in industrial settings where continuous monitoring of environmental parameters is crucial. By automating data collection and providing real-time insights, this project enhances workplace safety and compliance with industry regulations. Furthermore, the use of IoT technology ensures remote accessibility, reducing the need for manual inspections and improving overall efficiency. The project aims to provide a cost-effective and reliable solution for industrial environmental monitoring, making workplaces safer and more sustainable.
